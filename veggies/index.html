        <main><h1>Vegetable Garden</h1>
<p>&lt;!-- Insert a picture here --&gt;</p>
<p>I love growing my own vegetables. It's a great way to relax and enjoy the outdoors. Here are some of the vegetables I grow in my garden:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tomatoes</li>
<li>Cucumbers</li>
<li>Carrots (Including a rainbow variety for the kids)</li>
<li>Potatoes (sweet potatoes, regular potatoes)</li>
<li>Peppers (bell peppers, chili peppers)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalis_tuberosa">Oca</a> (a tuber from New Zealand)</li>
<li>Ginger</li>
<li>Asparagus (I'm still waiting for my first harvest)</li>
</ul>
<p>My garden also contains a some rhubarb few apple trees that I am yet to determine the variety of. In addition I have some fruit bushes, including blueberries, raspberries.
Kiwis are one of my favorite fruits, and I've thankfully managed to germinate some seedlings recently. I'm looking forward to seeing how they grow.</p>
<p>I'm starting to focus on Perrineal vegetables and fruits, as I'm looking to create a more sustainable garden. That doesn't require as much work as annuals.</p>
<p>I'm always looking for new things to grow, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know!</p>
