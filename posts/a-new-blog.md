After a long struggle with my old blog, I've decided to start fresh. I'm going to write about all the things that interest me, and I hope you'll enjoy reading about them.

I'm planning to write about:

- Software development
- Technology
- Books
- My vegetable garden
- And anything else that catches my interest

This blog will also act as a sort of public notebook for myself. I'm always learning new things, and I want to keep track of what I've learned. I hope that by writing about it, I'll be able to retain more information.

It will be interesting to see if I can keep up with this blog given my hectic family life, but I'm determined to give it a shot.
