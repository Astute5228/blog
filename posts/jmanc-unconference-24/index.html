      <h1>JManc Unconference 24</h1>

    <p>I recently attended the JManc Unconference 24, and it was a great experience. The event was held at the Auto Trader's office in Manchester, and it was a full day of discussing all things Java.</p>
<p>The day kicked off with a keynote from Helen Scott, a developer advocate at JetBrains, the keynote was focused on AI, touching on developer effectiveness.</p>
<p>The event followed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_space_technology">Open Space Technology</a> format where the attendees could propose sessions and join in on the ones that interested them. The schedule ended up as follows:</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/assets/img/ssg9mZtysD-250.webp 250w, /assets/img/ssg9mZtysD-426.webp 426w, /assets/img/ssg9mZtysD-580.webp 580w, /assets/img/ssg9mZtysD-768.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px)"><img alt="The decided schedule" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/assets/img/ssg9mZtysD-250.jpeg" width="768" height="768" srcset="/assets/img/ssg9mZtysD-250.jpeg 250w, /assets/img/ssg9mZtysD-426.jpeg 426w, /assets/img/ssg9mZtysD-580.jpeg 580w, /assets/img/ssg9mZtysD-768.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px)"></picture></p>
<p>It was interesting to hear other people's thoughts on each topic. I felt that some sessions lacked direction, but I think that's the nature of the format. The facilitators tried their best to navigate, avoiding <em>awkward conversations and silence.</em> I enjoyed the sessions that were more focused and had a clear direction on the topic being discussed.</p>
<p>There is one law of the Open Space Technology format: &quot;The Law of Two Feet&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If at any time during our time together you find yourself in any situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet, go someplace else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will remember this for next time. I'm looking forward it, and I hope to see some familiar faces there.</p>
