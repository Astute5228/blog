      <h1>From sitting, to standing, and now I'm on the floor</h1>

    <p>I've opted for taking apart my <a href="https://flexispot.co.uk/adjustable-standing-desk-pro-series.html">FlexiSpot standing desk</a> down in favour of a portable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabudai">Chabudai</a> style of table and a &quot;meditation&quot; cushion to sit on. These tables are really low down close to the ground and suited for working whilst sitting on the floor.</p>
<p>Long gone are the days of being constrained to a desk in my bedroom, but instead a small table I can set out anywhere in the house. I want to enjoy all parts of my home while WFH, and encourage myself to go out to work, whether this be at the office or a coffee shop. Essentially moving around a lot more!</p>
<p>Supposedly there are long term benefits to sitting naturally, on the floor. I'm sure it will take some getting used to.</p>
<p>These are the items for anyone interested:</p>
