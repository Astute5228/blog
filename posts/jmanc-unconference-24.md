I recently attended the JManc Unconference 24, and it was a great experience. The event was held at the Auto Trader's office in Manchester, and it was a full day of discussing all things Java.

The day kicked off with a keynote from Helen Scott, a developer advocate at JetBrains, the keynote was focused on AI, touching on developer effectiveness. 

The event followed an [Open Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_space_technology) format where the attendees could propose sessions and join in on the ones that interested them. The schedule ended up as follows:

It was interesting to hear other people's thoughts on each topic. I felt that some sessions lacked direction, but I think that's the nature of the format. The facilitators tried their best to navigate, avoiding _awkward conversations and silence._ I enjoyed the sessions that were more focused and had a clear direction on the topic being discussed.

There is one law of the Open Space Technology format: "The Law of Two Feet":

> If at any time during our time together you find yourself in any situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet, go someplace else.

I will remember this for next time. I'm looking forward it, and I hope to see some familiar faces there.
