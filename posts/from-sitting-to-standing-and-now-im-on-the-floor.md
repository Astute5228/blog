I've opted for taking apart my [FlexiSpot standing desk](https://flexispot.co.uk/adjustable-standing-desk-pro-series.html) down in favour of a portable [Chabudai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabudai) style of table and a "meditation" cushion to sit on. These tables are really low down close to the ground and suited for working whilst sitting on the floor.

Long gone are the days of being constrained to a desk in my bedroom, but instead a small table I can set out anywhere in the house. I want to enjoy all parts of my home while WFH, and encourage myself to go out to work, whether this be at the office or a coffee shop. Essentially moving around a lot more!

Supposedly there are long term benefits to sitting naturally, on the floor. I'm sure it will take some getting used to.

These are the items for anyone interested:
